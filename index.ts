/**
 * Typically if you want to create a component that extends another component's
 * implementation, you have two options:
 *
 *   1. Create a component which extends the base component (at the class
 *      inheritance level) and refernce your base component's template
 *      file directly in your Component's `templateUrl`
 *   2. Create a component which extends the base component, but also render
 *      an instance of the base component from your components template.
 *
 * In (1), there is only one instance of the component in question, and things
 * are relatively straightforward. However, (2) is your only option
 * if you need to implement a component that looks and acts like your base
 * component in every way except that its template needs to be wrapped with
 * some additional markup.
 *
 * You often run into (2) when creating container level components, or a component
 * that wants to wrap another component's template but include custom markup above
 * or below the template of the component it wraps.
 *
 * In the latter case, because you are rendering the html element
 * from the template of your extending component, you end up with two
 * instances of SimpleTableComponent. In the latter case, what is effectively
 * taking place is Object Composition (discussed to some extent here:
 * https://www.arcanys.com/blog/angular-components-templating-and-reusability).
 *
 * The tl;dr of object composition is that its difficult to maintain and makes
 * it very easy to code up a component that swallows many bits of the API of
 * the component it is intended to wrap, but it is often required.
 * We have suffered this pain on our codebase in simple-form-component,
 * which calls to confirm-dialog-container. confirm-dialod-container exposes
 * a TON of configuration options as @Inputs() (15 to be exact). In order for
 * simple-form.component to maintain the same level of customization as
 * confirm-dialog-container, we had to expose all of the
 * confirm-dialog-container @Inputs() as @Inputs() on simple-form-component, and
 * proxy them all to our own instance of confirm-dialog-container. This ExtendToTemplate
 * paradign __could__ be applied there as well (though a refactor to remove
 * dialog concerns from a form, or to leverage content projection will likely
 * prove to be the more prudent approach in that case).
 *
 * Angular supports component class inheritance by way of javascript class
 * inheritence, but they don't at all handle the idea of template inheritance.
 * ExtendToTemplate() helps us work around this shortcoming in the
 * Angular Framework.
 *
 * This whole concept of ExtendToTemplate() as well as the _extendToTemplateBridge we
 * autogenerate and set on "ourselves" exists to support the use case in (2)
 * and make the process as seamless as possible for future developers who
 * dont care about the implementation of simple-table itself, but only know
 * they need to be able to build a table that supports a different use case and
 * the API we all expect out of a component that looks like a simple table.
 * If it looks like a simple table, it should BE a simple table.
 *
 * This ExtendToTemplate() decorator is the little piece of magic that helps
 * maintainers of SimpleTableComponent quickly add new properties or methods
 * that a parent SimpleFormComponent instance needs to keep in sync with its
 * child when wrapping the form. This enables us to enhance the underlying
 * simple table implementation while minimizing existing implementations.
 * If we add a new @Input() to simple table, all of *SimpleTable components
 * will inherit it for free, without us having to write any code.
 *
 * How's it work? We decorate any SimpleTableComponent class property that should
 * get passed down to its child SimpleTableComponent instance with the
 * @ExtendToTemplate() decorator. This decorator maintains a list of
 * all class properties that contain the decorator on the instance of the class
 * itself. This list of properties is then used to auto-generate an object
 * which we pass down to our child simple-table via the _simpleTableRenderBridge.
 *
 * When one component that extends another needs to create its
 * own, internal instance of that component by way of wrapping
 * its template, the base component can extend DecoratedByExtendToTemplateComponent
 * and decorate properties that need to be synced between instances
 * with ExtendToTemplate(). From there, the decorator/base class
 * will  provide the _extendToTemplateBridge as a quick way to
 * pass all component inputs outputs, and member functions down
 * to your child instance.
 * To use:
 *    MyComponent extends DecoratedByExtendToTemplateComponent { ... }
 *    MyComponent2 extends MyComponent { ... }
 * And then in your template for my-component-2:
 *    <my-component
 *      [_extendToTemplateBridge]="_extendToTemplateBridge"
 *    >
 *    </my-component>
 * Now, anywhere in your app, you can use <my-component> OR <my-component-2>
 * interchangeable using the same exact component Input() and Output() API.
 *
 * Possible Future enhancements:
 * 	 - namespace support for extending subsets of a component API to different
